Not only that, he just casually &#34;drives through all the red lights&#34; so to speak and &#34;borrows&#34; their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to &#34;borrows&#34; McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American.\"],\n",
